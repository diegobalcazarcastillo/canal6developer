Canal 6 Developer for Diego Balcazar

This project is Developed with NetCore 5 and React!

This project is the base for an organization (Canal 6) I have all the rights to share this code with you.

It works with Clean Code Pattern Design (From Persistence to API with NetCore and Front-End with React).

With React, It works with Axios for API Rest calls and Mobx for state control. It connects to a SQL Server Database by EntityFrameworkCore.

If you are an IT recruiter this is an exmple of my skills working with the following technologys:
* Web Desing
* CSS / Javascript / HTML
* Typescript
* React Library management
* React State Management
* API Rest calls
* C#
* API Rest creation
* CORS Pattern Desing with Mediator
* Database calls with EntityFrameworkCore

Hope this helps to you!

Diego Balcazar.
